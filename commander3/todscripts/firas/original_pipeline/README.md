In each FXY directory there should be a FXY.hlp file that describes what the code in that directory is supposed to do. Most directories result in a standalone executable, though there might be a few directories that are just for utility functions. In each directory there is usually a separate file for each function/subroutine. There also might be a few directories that contain IDL code. This contains all of their code from both the first and last data release so directories like fcf and fsl do the same thing except fcf was used for the initial data release and fsl was used for the final data release (difference mainly being padding of IFGs).
