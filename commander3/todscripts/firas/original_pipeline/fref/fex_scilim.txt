*	File Name:       FEX_SCILIM.TXT
*
*	Purpose of File: To be used in creating the limits database for FDQ.
*
*	Designer:	 Shirley M. Read  ( STX )  January 1988
*
*	Description:
*                        File containing science and attitude limits.
*	                 Each line contains the field name of one of the
*			 Fex_Scilim RDL parameters followed by the integer
*			 values of the Red Limit and then the Yellow Limit.
*			 The order of the parameters on the line is fixed 
*			 but the starting column for each field may vary.
*		         Comment lines must begin with a '*' or a '!'. 
*	Assumptions: 
*	                 The angles are assumed to be in units of degrees.
*		         The altitude is assumed to be in units of 0.1 Km.
*			 If the corresponding data quality flag has only
*			 a 'Red' value, the red and yellow limits will be
*			 the same. Both positions must be filled.
*
*                        SPR 8898, Harte Wang, STX, 8/26/91
*                        The Glitch rate are assumed to be 100*counts/sec
*                        for all four channels(RH,RL,LH,LL)
*
*	1991 Sept 24 -
*	Origin of values: SC_HEAD20 see SER 8875 (Saturated Sample Count)
*			EARTH_LIMB see SER 8804
*			SUN_ANGLE see SER 8804 and 6511.
*			MOON_ANGLE see SER 8943, and 7288. 
*			GLIRAT_<channel> see SER 8876
*			Removed the ALTITUDE flag, as it is not used
*			DATA_READY set by telemetry requirement.
*		See also discussion of the FPPFDQ input certification.
*	1991 Oct 3 -
*	Modified MOON_ANGLE to 22 and 23 degrees, as per discussion at the
*		Pass 2 FPPFDQ Readiness review.
*
*	1992 August 17 -  S. Read, Hughes STX
*       Modifications to limits for Pass 2 A according to SPR 9864 as per 
*       analysis for liens against FDQ for Pass 2.
*       Raised Earth Limb / Sun Angle values to absurd levels and modified the 
*       glitch rate levels to allow more data in, based on the noise analysis.
*       Pass 2  Red and Yellow Limits were the following:
*          EARTH_LIMB     92    93    SUN_ANGLE     92    93         
*          GLIRAT_RH     232   300    GLIRAT_RL    119   132        
*          GLIRAT_LH      66    66    GLIRAT_LL     96   112   
*  	Certification:	Rick Shafer 1992 August 17 - Pass 2A
*				Pass 2 Liens:  FDQ-4, FDQ-5, FDQ-6, FDQ-8
