1 FIL
  The facility FIL (FIRAS Interferogram Long) averages homogeneous 
  interferograms in order to filter bad and inconsistent data, improve the 
  signal-to-noise ratio, and minimize subsequent processing time.  It is
  the successor to FIC (FIRAS Interferogram Coaddition), with several
  improvements, including the use of longer spectra.
2 Method
  FIL is able to ingest three forms of quality-checked data: calibration
  data which has been sorted into temperature plateaus and scan modes by 
  the facility FEC (FIRAS Extract Calibration), sky data which has been 
  similarly sorted by scan modes, internal calibrator temperature, and 
  pixel number by the facility FSS (FIRAS Sort Sky), and, for analysis 
  purposes, raw data which has been processed only by the facility FDQ 
  (FIRAS Data Qualify).  In the last case, FIL also has the capability to 
  filter incoming data to user specifications.

  The standard processing of a group of interferograms to be coadded 
  (averaged) is first to check them all for quality and instrument state 
  consistency, discarding any which fail.  They are then divided by the 
  instrument gain and sweeps values, and each interferogram's median value 
  is subtracted to remove the randomly added dither.

  Each interferogram is next deglitched; the effects of cosmic rays hitting 
  the detectors are eliminated.  The process involves subtraction of two 
  different types of midaverages of the data set (templates) from each 
  interferogram and cleaning of glitches from the resulting noise 
  interferograms.  After this cleaning, each member of the set is checked 
  for shape consistency and those which fail are discarded.

  The set of cleaned noise interferograms is then coadded.  The average 
  noise interferogram and also the averages of all relevant engineering and 
  attitude data are formed.  Weights vectors and covariance matrices for 
  statistical purposes are calculated as well.  The previously subtracted 
  midaverages (templates) are then added back to the average noise 
  interferogram.  Last, a quartic baseline is fitted to each interferogram 
  and subtracted from it.
2 Logical_Pointers
  FIL uses five logical pointers to direct data input and output:

  CSDR$FIRAS_IN     The archive containing short science input records
                    (those produced by FSS or FEC).

  CSDR$FIRAS_RAW    The archive containing full science and engineering
                    input records (those produced by FDQ).

  CSDR$FIRAS_OUT    The archive containing all output data files from
                    FIL except for covariance matrices.

  CSDR$FIRAS_STAT   The archive containing the covariance matrices,
                    which may be input or output.

  CSDR$FIRAS_REF    The archive containing all reference data sets
                    required by FIL.
2 Input_Data_Sets
  Input to FIL falls into one of three processing branches:  sky, 
  calibration, or raw data.  (In the following, "cc" refers to one of the 
  four channels RH, LH, RL, and LL; "ss" refers to one of the four scan 
  modes SS, SF, LS, and LF.)    

  Input to the sky data processing branch of FIL includes short science 
  records from FSS (FSS_SSSKY_cc), full science records from FDQ 
  (FDQ_SDF_cc), and engineering records from FDQ (FDQ_ENG).  It may also 
  include covariance matrices and associated statistical information from 
  one or more previous invocations of FIL (FIL_COV_ccss).

  Input to the calibration data processing branch of FIL includes short 
  science records from FEC (FEC_SSCAL_cc), full science records from FDQ 
  (FDQ_SDF_cc), and engineering records from FDQ (FDQ_ENG).

  Input to the raw data processing branch of FIL includes only full science 
  and engineering records from FDQ (FDQ_SDF_cc and FDQ_ENG).  The 
  engineering data may be filtered by a collection of record selection 
  expressions in an RSE file; in this case the index file FDQ_IDX is also 
  required.
2 Output_Data_Sets
  Output from FIL is in one of seven output types.  (In the following, "cc"
  refers to one of the four channels RH, LH, RL, and LL; "ss" refers to one 
  of the four scan modes SS, SF, LS, and LF.  An "x" may be either "S" for 
  skymaps output from the sky processing branch or "C" for time-ordered 
  output from the calibration or raw data branches; note that the latter 
  two branches have identical output names.)

  Five of the seven output types share the same record structure.  These 
  are:  the primary template (FIL_xPT_ccss), the secondary template 
  (FIL_xST_ccss), deglitched interferograms (FIL_xDG_ccss), the coadded 
  interferogram (FIL_xCO_ccss), and the baseline-subtracted interferogram 
  (FIL_SKY_ccss or FIL_CAL_ccss).  Each of these produces one output record 
  per coadd group, except the deglitch output type, which produces one 
  record per input interferogram.

  The primary and secondary template outputs are identical to the coadded
  interferogram output, if a coadd was made, except that the actual 
  interferogram is replaced by the respective template.

  The deglitch outputs also share all information recorded in the coadd 
  record up to actual deglitching, with the deglitched interferogram placed 
  in the coadded interferogram position, and with the coefficients 
  associated with secondary template and digital transient subtraction 
  placed in each output record.

  The sixth output data type is the consistency check data set 
  (FIL_xCC_ccss).  One record is produced for each input interferogram; 
  each contains information about the instrument state, attitude, noise, 
  deglitching if the deglitcher was invoked, and the failure reason, if 
  any, from consistency checking.

  The seventh output data type is the covariance matrix (FIL_COV_ccss), 
  associated only with the sky data processing branch and only with the 
  scan modes SS, SF, and LF.  Sky interferograms are assigned to one of 256 
  statistical bins based on certain science and engineering data.  Each 
  covariance matrix data set consists of 257 records; the first is a header 
  record storing statistical information about the coadded interferogram, 
  and the remaining 256 records each have information about the 
  interferograms in one of the bins.

  The covariance matrix itself is a symmetric matrix; the upper half plus 
  the diagonal elements total 266815 values.  These values may further be
  divided into three sections:  the real-real, real-imaginary, and 
  imaginary-imaginary parts.  They are stored in records 2 through 257 as
  follows:  the real-real part, a triangular submatrix, is stored as a
  single vector in records 2 through 67, with 1050 values in each record;
  the real-imaginary part, a rectangular submatrix, is stored as a single
  vector in records 68 through 194, with 1050 values in each record; and the
  imaginary-imaginary part, a triangular submatrix, is stored similarly in
  records 195 through 257.

2 Command_Line_Qualifiers
  The following qualifiers are available to guide FIL processing.
3 INPUT
  INPUT=(SKY | CALIBRATION | RAW)
  INPUT=SKY  default

  Specifies the source of the input data to be a skymap of pixel-ordered
  sky data from FSS, or a time-ordered file of either calibration data 
  from FEC or raw data from FDQ.
3 CHANNEL
  CHANNEL=(RH | RL | LH | LL | RIGHT | LEFT | HIGH | LOW | ALL)
  CHANNEL=ALL  default

  Specifies the channels for which FIL is to process input data.
3 SCAN_MODE
  SCAN_MODE=(SS | SF | LS | LF | FS | FL | ALL)
  SCAN_MODE=ALL  default

  Specifies the scan mode for which FIL is to process input data.  If a 
  scan mode is specified, all other scan modes will be ignored in 
  processing.  Note that scan modes FS and FL apply only to low channel
  data.
3 FILE
  FILE=<filename_extension>
  NOFILE  default

  Specifies that input data is to be read from the file with the given 
  filename extension.  A complete filename may be given, but only the 
  extension will be used.  The filename itself is specified by the INPUT 
  and CHANNEL qualifiers.  If this qualifier is used, a filename value is 
  required.

  This is the standard qualifier for sky data input; FIL will process only
  one skymap per invocation.

  The use of FILE as an input qualifier precludes the use of JSTART or 
  JSTOP.
3 JSTART
  JSTART=<yydddhhmmssccc>
  JSTART=86001000000000  default

  Specifies the Julian start time.  It is used directly for time-ordered 
  calibration or raw data and is used to search the archive catalog for 
  pixel-ordered sky data.  If more than one skymap is found in the given
  range, the one with the latest activity time is chosen.

  "yy" is the year, "ddd" is the day, "hh" is the hour, "mm" is the 
  minute, "ss" is the second, and "ccc" is the millisecond.

  The JSTART and JSTOP qualifiers are the standard input qualifiers for 
  calibration or raw data.

  JSTART cannot be used in conjunction with FILE.
3 JSTOP
  JSTOP=<yydddhhmmssccc>
  JSTOP=99365235959999  default

  Specifies the Julian stop time.  It is used directly for time-ordered 
  calibration or raw data and is used to search the archive catalog for 
  pixel-ordered sky data.  If more than one skymap is found in the given
  range, the one with the latest activity time is chosen.

  "yy" is the year, "ddd" is the day, "hh" is the hour, "mm" is the 
  minute, "ss" is the second, and "ccc" is the millisecond.

  The JSTART and JSTOP qualifiers are the standard input qualifiers for 
  calibration or raw data.

  JSTOP cannot be used in conjunction with FILE.
3 RSE
  RSE=<filename>
  NORSE  default
   
  Specifies a file containing record selection expressions (RSEs) to be 
  applied to the input data to filter it to user specifications.  If this
  qualifier is used, a filename value is required.

  This qualifier may only be used with INPUT=RAW.
3 NEIGHBORS
  NEIGHBORS=<value>;  4 is default when NEIGHBORS is specified
  NONEIGHBORS  default

  Specifies use of interferograms from neighboring pixels for the purpose
  of template formation.  If, after instrument state consistency checking,
  there are at least as many good interferograms excluding neighbors as
  the value of the NEIGHBORS qualifier, then neighbors will not be used
  in template formation.

  This qualifier may be used only for sky data.
3 ORPHANS
  ORPHANS
  NOORPHANS  default

  Specifies that coadd groups marked as orphan (having fewer than the
  minimum number of interferograms to coadd) by FSS should be read and
  coadded by FIL, using interferograms from neighboring pixels as needed.

  This qualifier may be used only for sky data.
3 POOL_MAX
  POOL_MAX=<value>;  15 is default when POOL_MAX is specified
  NOPOOL_MAX  default

  Specifies the number of interferograms from neighboring pixels to be
  read if they are required.  If the number of interferograms excluding
  neighbors is less than the value of POOL_MAX, and NEIGHBORS or ORPHANS
  has been requested, then neighbor interferograms will be read until
  the value of POOL_MAX is reached, if there are enough neighbors to do
  so.
3 GROUP_MAX
  GROUP_MAX=<value>;  10 is default when GROUP_MAX is specified
  NOGROUP_MAX  default

  Specifies the number of interferograms from neighboring pixels to be
  used in template formation.  If neighbors need to be used for forming
  the templates, then neighbors will be selected, if they exist, so that
  a group of total size equal to the value of GROUP_MAX will form the
  templates.  If there are more neighbors than are needed, then they are
  selected on the basis of least absolute difference of galactic latitude
  from the average galactic latitude of the non-neighbor coadd group when
  this average is within a FEX_CTH specified range around the galactic
  plane, and they are selected on the basis of increasing glitch rate if
  not.
3 COVAR
  COVAR=(NEW | UPDATE);  UPDATE is default when COVAR is specified
  NOCOVAR  default
   
  Specifies initializing or updating appropriate covariance matrices and 
  associated statistical data.  COVAR=UPDATE will cause FIL to read in 
  existing covariance matrices or to create new ones if none can be found.

  This qualifier can only be used with INPUT=SKY, and cannot be used with
  SCAN_MODE=LS, NOINST_STATE, NOPIXEL_NO, NODEGLITCH, NOSHAPE_CHECK, or  
  NOCOADD.
3 QUALITY
  QUALITY=(INSTRUMENT=<threshold>,ATTITUDE=<threshold>)
  QUALITY=(INSTRUMENT=3,ATTITUDE=3)  default

  Specifies maximum acceptable data and attitude quality of input data. 
  Data with qualities less than or equal to the specified thresholds are 
  accepted for processing.  The thresholds are defined as follows:

        0 = no data quality established
        1 = no yellow or red limit violations
        2 = some yellow limit violations
        3 = many yellow limit violations
        4 = no yellow and some red limit violations
        5 = some yellow and some red limit violations
        6 = many yellow and some red limit violations
        7 = many red limit violations

  Quality checking is invariably performed on all input data.  Sky data 
  should normally be processed with the default quality thresholds of 3.  
  Calibration data should normally be processed with an instrument quality 
  threshold of 3 and an attitude quality threshold of 32 (no attitude 
  solution), as calibration data does not depend on the presence of 
  attitude information.
3 SINGLE
  SINGLE
  NOSINGLE  default

  Specifies that single interferograms, and not coadd groups, be processed 
  by FIL.  This qualifier may be used with any input type, and will cause 
  each input interferogram to be divided by gain and sweeps, have its 
  dither and optionally its baseline subtracted, and be written out as a 
  coadd record.  Engineering sigmas and weights vectors are set to flag 
  values. 

  This qualifier disables consistency checking, deglitching, and 
  covariance matrix formation, and cannot be used with COVAR or NOCOADD.
3 INST_STATE
  INST_STATE  default
  NOINST_STATE

  Specifies instrument state consistency checking, which makes certain 
  that instrument parameters (such as adds per group and science mode) are 
  consistent within the coadd group.  Inconsistent interferograms are 
  marked and do not contribute to output coadds.
3 PIXEL_NO
  PIXEL_NO  default
  NOPIXEL_NO

  Specifies that consistency checking of the interferogram's pixel number
  should be enabled or disabled.  This qualifier is usually used for 
  INPUT=RAW, when consistency checking of the pixel number might fail most 
  of the data.
3 SEC_TEMPLATE
  SEC_TEMPLATE  default
  NOSEC_TEMPLATE

  Specifies that secondary template subtraction should be enabled or 
  disabled.  Even if it is disabled, the secondary template will still be 
  calculated and may be written as output.
3 DEGLITCH
  DEGLITCH  default
  NODEGLITCH

  Specifies that interferograms will be deglitched.
3 SHAPE_CHECK
  SHAPE_CHECK  default
  NOSHAPE_CHECK

  Specifies shape consistency checking, including comparing the ratio of 
  the noise of individual interferograms with the noise of the coadd group 
  and checking for outlier points.  Interferograms failing these checks 
  are marked and do not contribute to a coadd.
3 COADD
  COADD  default
  NOCOADD

  Specifies the coaddition, or averaging, of the interferograms and 
  associated science and engineering data.

  Note that interferograms from neighboring pixels are never coadded.
3 BASELINE_SUB
  BASELINE_SUB  default
  NOBASELINE_SUB

  Specifies baseline calculation and subtraction from the coadded
  interferogram.

  This qualifier cannot be used with NOCOADD.
3 OUTPUT
  OUTPUT=(TEMPLATE,SEC_TEMPLATE,DEGLITCH,CON_CHECK,COADD,BASELINE_SUB)
  NOOUTPUT
  OUTPUT=BASELINE_SUB  default

  Specifies the output data that FIL is to produce.  The output types are, 
  in order, the primary template, secondary template, deglitched 
  interferograms, consistency check results, the coadded interferogram, 
  and the baseline-subtracted interferogram.

  One or a combination of values may be chosen.

  OUTPUT=TEMPLATE and OUTPUT=SEC_TEMPLATE may not be used if SINGLE or 
  both NODEGLITCH and NOSHAPECHEK have been specified, as in these cases 
  the templates are not formed.

  OUTPUT=DEGLITCH may not be used with SINGLE or NODEGLITCH.

  OUTPUT=COADD may not be used with NOCOADD.

  OUTPUT=BASELINE_SUB may not be used with NOBASELINE_SUB.

  Note that the CON_CHECK output will not include any interferograms from
  neighboring pixels.
3 OUTFILE
  OUTFILE=<filename_extension>
  NOOUTFILE  default

  Specifies the filename extension to be used for output data files.  The
  filename itself is given by the OUTPUT and CHANNEL qualifiers.  A 
  complete filename may be given as the value to this qualifier, but only 
  the extension will be used.

  If this qualifier is not specified, the default output filename 
  extension is ED_<yydddhh>_<yydddhh> where "yydddhh" specifies the first
  seven numbers of JSTART and JSTOP.

  No output filename may be specified when NOOUTPUT has been selected.
3 REPORT
  REPORT=(SUMMARY | DETAIL); SUMMARY is default when REPORT is used
  REPORT=(SUMMARY=<filename> | DETAIL=<filename>)
  NOREPORT  default

  Specifies that reports for each channel and scan mode of processed data 
  are to be produced.  

  A summary report file is always produced by FIL; this qualifier permits 
  the user to request an additional summary or detailed report for each 
  channel and scan mode combination.  These reports contain the results of 
  consistency checking and deglitching.  REPORT=DETAIL will result in the 
  listing of the positions and amplitudes of all glitches found in each 
  interferogram.

  If no filename is given by the user, a default one will be constructed:
  FIL_<yydddhh>_<yydddhh>.REP_<yydddhhmm> where the first two "yydddhh" 
  values refer to the first seven numbers of JSTART and JSTOP, 
  respectively, and the last "yydddhhmm" refers to the first nine numbers 
  of the time FIL is run in Julian format.  The default names of the 
  channel and scan mode reports are:  
  FIL_<yydddhh>_<yydddhh>_ccss.REP_<yydddhhmm> as for the overall summary 
  report, and where "cc" is one of the channels RH, LH, RL, and LL, and 
  "ss" is one of the scan modes SS, SF, LS, and LF.

  REPORT=DETAIL cannot be used with SINGLE or NODEGLITCH, since in those 
  cases the deglitcher does not operate.

  Note that report files do not include information about interferograms
  from neighboring pixels.
2 Examples
  To process calibration data for the entire FIRAS mission period, use the
  following command line:

  FIL/INPUT=CALIBRATION/JSTART=89324/JSTOP=90264 -
     /QUALITY=(INSTRUMENT=3,ATTITUDE=32)/REPORT -
     /OUTPUT=(BASELINE_SUB,CON_CHECK)

  In this example, calibration short science records will be read from 
  FEC_SSCAL files in all channels in the CSDR$FIRAS_IN archive.  Records 
  will be rejected if their instrument quality is greater than 3, but any 
  attitude quality will be accepted.

  An overall summary report named FIL_8932400_9026423.REP_921231054 will be 
  produced along with reports for each channel and scan mode named, for 
  example, FIL_8932400_9026423_RHSS.REP_921231054.  These reports will all 
  be written to the directory from which FIL is invoked. 

  Output data sets will be CSDR$FIRAS_OUT:FIL_CAL_RHSS.ED_8932400_9026423 
  and CSDR$FIRAS_OUT:FIL_CCC_RHSS.ED_8932400_9026423 for all channel and 
  scan mode combinations for which input data is found.

  To process sky data for the first FIRAS mission period in the right high
  channel, use the following command line:

  FIL/FILE=ED_8932800_8934301/CHANNEL=RH/REPORT/COVAR -
     /OUTPUT=(TEMPLATE,SEC_TEMPLATE,BASELINE_SUB,CON_CHECK)

  In this example, the short science skymap 
  CSDR$FIRAS_IN:FSS_SSSKY_RH.ED_8932800_8934301 will be read.

  An overall summary report named FIL_8932800_8934301.REP_921231054 will be 
  produced along with reports for each channel and scan mode named, for 
  example, FIL_8932800_8934301_RHSS.REP_921231054.  These reports will all 
  be written to the directory from which FIL is invoked. 

  Output data sets will be: CSDR$FIRAS_OUT:FIL_SPT_RHSS.ED_8932800_8934301,
  CSDR$FIRAS_OUT:FIL_SST_RHSS.ED_8932800_8934301,
  CSDR$FIRAS_OUT:FIL_SKY_RHSS.ED_8932800_8934301,
  and CSDR$FIRAS_OUT:FIL_SCC_RHSS.ED_8932800_8934301, for all scan modes
  for which input data is found.

  In addition, covariance matrices such as
  CSDR$FIRAS_STAT:FIL_COV_RHSS.ED_8932800_8934301 will be written for all 
  scan modes for which input data is found.  They will be updates of 
  matrices already generated for this time period, if any can be found in
  CSDR$FIRAS_STAT.

  To use orphan interferograms and interferograms from neighboring pixels,
  the command line might be:

  FIL/CHANNEL=LL/SCAN=FS/FILE=ED_8934301_9001902/REPORT/COVAR -
     /NEIGHBORS=6/ORPHANS/POOL_MAX=10/GROUP_MAX=6

  In this example, the short science skymap 
  CSDR$FIRAS_IN:FSS_SSSKY_LL.ED_8934301_9001902 will be read.
  Only coadd groups in the SF scan mode will be used, but of these,
  all coadd groups, including those marked as orphans, will be
  read.  If there are fewer than 10 interferograms excluding neighbors,
  then neighbors will be read until there are no more to read, or until
  the total coadd group numbers 10.

  After instrument state consistency checking, if there are 6 or more
  interferograms excluding neighbors that are acceptable, then no
  neighbors will be used in template formation.  Otherwise, neighbors
  will be chosen so that the total group numbers 6, if there are enough
  neighbors to do so.  The choice of neighbors is based either on
  galactic latitude or on glitch rate, depending on how close the
  pixel is to the galactic plane.

  While neighbors will be used in template formation and to guide the
  deglitcher, they will not be coadded.

  Output data sets will be:
  CSDR$FIRAS_OUT:FIL_SKY_LLFS.ED_8934301_9001902,
  and CSDR$FIRAS_STAT:FIL_COV_LLFS.ED_8934301_9001902.
