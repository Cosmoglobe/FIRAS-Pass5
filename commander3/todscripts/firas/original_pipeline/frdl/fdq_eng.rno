.header level Engineering_Data_File (FDQ_ENG)

    This file describes the status of the FIRAS instrument.  Stored
within this file are instrument temperatures, voltages, currents,
microprocessor status words and other important engineering quantities.
It is cross-indexed with the Engineering Index
so that engineering data can be retrieved
on the basis of these engineering quantities.  It is also cross-indexed
with raw science IFGs such that IFGs can be retrieved on the same basis.
