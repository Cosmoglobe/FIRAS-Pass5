.header level Engineering_Extrema (FXT_ENG_XTRM)

    This data set keeps a history of engineering analog minima and maxima.
Facility FXT_LOG_EXTREMA searches the engineering archive for analog values
that exceed the set of engineering extrema last written to Engineering
Extrema archive.
    This is a time-tagged data set.  In this case, the effective timerange is
the start and stop times of the engineering segments processed by facility
FXT_LOG_EXTREMA.
