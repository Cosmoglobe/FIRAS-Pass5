.header level Noise_Spectra (FNT_NOISE)

   This file contains the results of noise analysis performed by
FNT_NOISETEST.  Spectra from when the instrument is in the fake-it mode
are formed, in units of volts*Hz**0.5.  There is a file for each channel within
which there is a record for each instrument scan mode.
   Several noise spectra from each channel and scan mode are written to the
archive each month, from calibration runs.
