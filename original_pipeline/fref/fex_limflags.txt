*	File Name:       FEX_LIMFLAGS.TXT
*
*	Description:
*                          File containing flags to enable or disable the limit
*		         checking for FIRAS telemetry and instrument compoments.
*	                 Each line contains the name of the data quality flag 
*			 in the FEX_Limflags record (which may map to an array
*			 of flags) followed by the number of array elements 
*			 for the flag (set to 1 if not array), followed by
*			 the values of the flag elements,. Most flags 
*			 have a value of 0 or -1 ( False or True ). The rest
*			 of the flags are bit masks for flags which represent
*		         checks on a composite of FIRAS components. 
*		           There are 110 limit flag fields, corresponding to 
*			 110 data quality flags in the NFS_SDF. The order of
*			 the parameters on the line is fixed, including array
*			 elements, but the starting column for each parameter
*			 may vary. There are no continuations. The setting of
*			 the flags for each side of the spacecraft is not 
*			 implemented for Build 4.0. This enhancement will 
*		         not be implemented unless separate limits and 
*			 conversions are defined for the two spacecraft sides.
*			 For flag arrays dimensioned by two for spacecraft
*		         side, the second half of the array in the FEX_Limflags
*			 record will not have values.
*		           Comment lines must begin with a '*' or a '!' in
*			 column one. Blank lines are allowed.
*	Assumptions: 
*			 The positions of the individual flags in the
*			 FEX_Limflags structure remain constant.
*
*	Purpose of File: To be used in creating the limits database for FDQ.

*		 	   Reason: To implement new design features of limit 
*			   checking for Build 4.0.
