COMMENT 
COMMENT     For the fields BIN_TOTAL, WTD_BIN_TOTAL, EFF_WT, RDISP, 
COMMENT     IDISP, and TEMP, each record number corresponds to a 
COMMENT     classification number depending on eight different 
COMMENT     instrument conditions:  whether Xcal, Ical, Refhorn, 
COMMENT     Skyhorn temperatures, glitch rate, and galactic latitude 
COMMENT     are over/under certain limits, whether data were taken 
COMMENT     before/after turning off the MTM in SAA passages, and 
COMMENT     whether a secondary template was subtracted in the 
COMMENT     coaddition process.  Yes/no answers to each of the above 
COMMENT     questions (in order) result in 2^8=256 categories.  To 
COMMENT     match a category to a record number, subtract 1 from the 
COMMENT     record number, render it in binary, and read the yes/no 
COMMENT     answers corresponding to the above categories from RIGHT 
COMMENT     to LEFT respectively.  For example, if record number 158 
COMMENT     contains non-zero data and the user wishes to calculate the
COMMENT     corresponding binning criteria, first subtract 1 to get 157, 
COMMENT     which in binary notation is 10011101.  Thus record 158 
COMMENT     contains information regarding data taken with a hot Xcal, 
COMMENT     normal Ical, Hot Refhorn and Skyhorn, high glitch rate, low 
COMMENT     galactic latitude, before the MTM was turned off in 
COMMENT     SAA passages, and with secondary template subtracted.  
COMMENT     Conversely, if the user wishes to check whether any 
COMMENT     IFGs had the above mentioned characteristics, converting 
COMMENT     10011101 to base 10 then adding 1 will indicate that the 
COMMENT     relevant information is in record number 158.   
COMMENT     
COMMENT     The fields BIN_TOTAL, WTD_BIN_TOTAL, EFF_WT, RDISP, IDISP, 
COMMENT     and TEMP will be zero in many records because no
COMMENT     IFGs in the data set matched the criteria corresponding to
